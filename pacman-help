1. Start with maze (text file?)

2. Online resources
to animate: timer to animate back and forth between 3 legged and 4 legged versions
timer.py: for animation
timer dual for flashing ghosts of death animation... each frame type has a timer
all you have to do is call imagerect to give you the frame index and let you know which frame should be displayed at the time
TIMER IS ON THE MIDTERM: dual timer frame index calls timer frame index
portal code:
-- self.x, self.y = x, y // pythonic style
maze creation code turns txt file into maze

inkscape: group and ungroup to make big blocks out of little blocks

use inkscape bezier tutorial for ghosts - simple tutorials

maze file:

self.bricks = [] -- obstacles in maze and barriers
self.shields = [] -- the ghost house has a little shield in the middle pacman can't go into
self.points = [] -- points hes trying to eat
self.nodes = {} -- used for djikstra algorithm -> where ghost is going to make path decision -> put nodes at ALL decision points

self.bricks = list() or self.bricks = [] --> same thing
self.nodes = dict() or self.nodes = {} --> same thing

self.build() --> builder design pattern

initialize maze in game file -> self.maze = Maze(..., brickfile='square') --> where do I load this file?
also with open(filename, r) as f --> means I don't have to close file because with open will automatically close for you
imagerect file -> loads image plus sets parameters .left,.top,.image (by loads image what i mean is brickfile, and all of those)
in maze file build --> v and h means portal going to wall feel free to pull those codes out so its easier to just pull portal on floor

his files -> character, dijkstra, direction, eventloop, expandfile, game, ghost, imagerect, logger, maze, pacman, portal, portalportal, timer, vector

logger file --> cls for pep8 should be self

SET UP TRELLO ACCOUNT -> SEND PROFESSOR EMAIL WITH ACCOUNT --> PUBLIC ACCOUNT


ghost:
Each ghost goes to one different corner
--> get dijkstra to find closest path for ghost ai
use vector code to find (calculate) vector distances?
if distance between target and me is getting smaller -> follow a path to get closer to target.
start with only one ghost and no pacman to get each ghost working at a time.
once ghost reaches location update target to pacman?

vector class updated!!!



3/6:
- make program run, show maze, show animated/moving pacman and ghosts (ai - even if it doesn't
chase anything), ghost actually tries to find pacman and eats it, pacman can eat power pill and
kill ghosts

you can slow down the game and can make key called go to next node in path to check if he got there to test if
path find is working correctly - check if he's going from node to node to node...

if you get done before deadline (HAHAHAHAHA GOOD ONE)... go to raywenderlich site and start
unreal tutorials -> unreal engine tutorial for beginners -> DO PART ONE TUTORIAL BEFORE CLASS

- ignore any ghost movement JUST focus on dijkstra
-> scatter mode (set target in map text file?)
find distance before you have to stop
